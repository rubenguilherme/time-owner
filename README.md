# Time Owner

Time Owner is an app being developed for Android by a student of the University of Beira Interior in Portugal.

I'm currently on my way to start my Master's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering and in my free time I like to work on this project.
It was created with the objective of helping me better manage my time and will one day be available as a free app on the Google Play Store for anyone with the same objectives as me.

### Features currently implemented:
- To-do list with an add and update page;
- Calendar with the possibility to create events (to-do items that have time restrictions);
- Splash screen and on boarding screen
- And more to be added!

### Features on their way:
- Notifications about events and to-do items (one day before, an hour before, not completed, etc..);
- Week schedule with the possibility to organize to-do items and allocate them to a spot in the schedule;
- Different languages (currently only English):
  - Portuguese
  - Spanish
  - French
